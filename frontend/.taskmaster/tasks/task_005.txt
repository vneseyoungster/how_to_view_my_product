**TASK DEPRECATED**

As per updated user requirements, the application only needs three document-specific pages:
1. Balance Sheet
2. Cash Flow
3. Income Statement

The Assets page has been removed from the scope, so this component implementation is no longer needed.

# Test Strategy:
No testing required as this component has been removed from the project scope.
