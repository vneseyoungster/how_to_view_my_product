# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Document-Specific Data Filtering
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create utility functions to filter and process data based on document type for use in the document-specific result pages.
# Details:
This task has been completed as part of the BaseResultsPage component implementation.

The document-specific data filtering functionality has been implemented directly within the BaseResultsPage component through the `getFilteredFinancialData` function in BaseResultsPage.tsx. This function handles:

1. Filtering financial data by document type (balance-sheet, cash-flow, income-statement, assets)
2. Comprehensive metric filtering for each document type
3. Proper error handling for missing or malformed data
4. Type safety through TypeScript definitions

No separate dataFilters.ts utility file was needed as the functionality was integrated directly into the component that uses it, which is a valid architectural decision that keeps related code together.

# Test Strategy:
The implemented filtering functionality in BaseResultsPage.tsx should be verified for:

1. Correct filtering of data for each document type
2. Proper handling of edge cases (missing or malformed data)
3. Type safety compliance
4. Performance with various dataset sizes
5. Integration with the document-specific result pages
