# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create BaseResultsPage Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a BaseResultsPage component that extracts shared logic and utilities from the current ViewResults page to be used by all document-specific pages.
# Details:
1. Create a new file BaseResultsPage.tsx in the ViewResults directory
2. Extract common functionality from the existing ViewResults page
3. Implement props interface to accept document-type-specific configurations
4. Include shared utilities for data processing, chart rendering, and UI components
5. Implement session storage access for document data
6. Create hooks for common data operations
7. Ensure the component is properly typed with TypeScript

Example structure:
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ChartComponent } from '../components/ChartComponent';

interface BaseResultsPageProps {
  documentType: 'balance-sheet' | 'cash-flow' | 'income-statement' | 'assets';
  charts: React.ReactNode[];
  // Other document-specific props
}

export const BaseResultsPage: React.FC<BaseResultsPageProps> = ({
  documentType,
  charts,
  ...props
}) => {
  // Common state and hooks
  // Data processing logic
  // Session storage access
  
  return (
    <div className="results-container">
      <h1>{documentType} Analysis</h1>
      {/* Common UI elements */}
      <div className="charts-container">
        {charts}
      </div>
      {/* Other shared UI components */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the BaseResultsPage component with different prop configurations
2. Verify that all shared functionality works correctly
3. Test session storage integration
4. Ensure proper rendering of common UI elements
5. Test with mock data for different document types

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create BaseResultsPage component structure and props interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial BaseResultsPage.tsx file with the component structure and define the TypeScript interface for props that will be accepted from document-specific pages.
### Details:
Create a new file BaseResultsPage.tsx in the ViewResults directory. Define a comprehensive props interface (BaseResultsPageProps) that includes documentType, charts, and other configurable properties needed by different document types. Create the basic component structure with proper TypeScript typing and export it. Include JSDoc comments for better developer experience.

I've successfully created BaseResultsPage.tsx with the component structure and comprehensive props interface. The file includes:
- BaseResultsPageProps interface with documentType and children props
- BaseResultsPageReturn interface with all shared state, handlers, and data getters
- useBaseResultsPage custom hook that extracts all shared logic from ViewResultsPage
- BaseResultsPage component that renders the base layout with document-specific title
- Proper TypeScript typing and JSDoc comments
- Export of all necessary interfaces and components

The component is now ready for the next step of implementing session storage access and data retrieval functionality.

## 2. Implement session storage access and data retrieval [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Extract and implement the session storage access logic from the existing ViewResults page to retrieve and manage document data.
### Details:
Create custom hooks for session storage operations (useSessionStorage). Implement functions to retrieve, store, and update document data in session storage. Handle edge cases like missing data and type conversions. Ensure proper error handling for storage operations. This should be reusable across all document types.
<info added on 2025-06-17T05:04:12.948Z>
The session storage functionality has been fully implemented in the BaseResultsPage.tsx file through the useBaseResultsPage hook. This implementation includes comprehensive session storage operations such as loading uploaded files, processing results, and summary results with proper error handling for missing data and JSON parsing errors. The hook also includes logic for detecting mock data usage, checking processing completion status, and automatic navigation to the upload page when necessary. Since this functionality is already working as intended and integrated into the component, this subtask can be marked as completed without additional implementation work required.

## 3. Extract common data processing utilities [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Extract data processing logic from the existing ViewResults page that can be shared across different document types.
### Details:
Create utility functions for common data transformations needed for charts and displays. Implement data normalization, filtering, and aggregation functions. Extract calculation logic that applies to multiple document types. Create typed interfaces for all data structures. Package these utilities in a way that document-specific pages can easily use them with their unique data structures.
<info added on 2025-06-17T05:04:42.207Z>
The following utility functions have been implemented in BaseResultsPage.tsx:

- transformCashFlowData: Transforms backend cash flow and income statement data
- getFinancialData: Retrieves financial metrics from summary or processing results
- getCompleteFinancialData: Combines all financial data including transformed cash flow data
- getFilteredFinancialData: Filters financial data by document type with document-specific metric filtering
- getUploadedFilesStats: Calculates statistics for uploaded files
- formatCurrency: Formats numeric values as currency

All utilities are properly typed and integrated into the useBaseResultsPage hook, making them easily accessible for document-specific pages to use with their unique data structures.

## 4. Implement shared UI components and layout structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the shared UI structure and layout components that will be common across all document result pages.
### Details:
Implement the base layout structure including headers, containers, and common UI elements. Create placeholder sections for document-specific content that will be passed as props. Implement responsive design considerations. Add loading states and error handling UI components. Ensure accessibility compliance for all shared UI elements. Use CSS modules or styled components for styling.
<info added on 2025-06-17T05:05:11.459Z>
Shared UI components and layout structure have been implemented in BaseResultsPage.tsx:
- BaseResultsPage component with complete layout structure including Paper, Box containers
- Loading state with CircularProgress component
- Error handling with Alert component
- Responsive design with sx props for padding and spacing
- ProcessingSummary component for displaying processing status and mock data controls
- PromptInfoDisplay component for showing AI summarization information
- SummaryTypeSelector component for future summary type selection
- Document-specific title rendering with gradient styling
- Footer with copyright information
All UI components are accessible, responsive, and properly styled using Material-UI.

## 5. Create chart rendering framework and integration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Implement the shared chart rendering framework that will be used by all document types with customization options.
### Details:
Create flexible chart components that can be configured for different document types. Implement chart configuration options as part of the props interface. Extract chart rendering logic from the existing ViewResults page. Create chart-specific data transformation utilities. Implement chart title, legend, and tooltip standardization. Ensure charts are responsive and accessible. Add options for different visualization types (bar, line, pie, etc.).
<info added on 2025-06-17T05:07:14.819Z>
Successfully created the chart rendering framework:
- Created chartConfig.ts with comprehensive chart type definitions and document-to-chart mapping
- Implemented chart configuration for all document types (balance-sheet, cash-flow, income-statement, assets)
- Created utility functions to check data availability and get enabled charts
- Built DocumentSpecificCharts.tsx component that dynamically renders charts based on document type
- Integrated existing chart components (CashFlowTrendChart, IncomeBreakdownChart)
- Added placeholders for future chart implementations
- Implemented responsive tab navigation with auto-scrolling
- Added proper loading states and error handling
The framework is flexible and easily extensible for adding new chart types.
