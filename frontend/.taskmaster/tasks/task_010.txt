# Task ID: 10
# Title: Enhance Session Storage for Document Types
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review and document the existing session storage implementation for document types that has been integrated into components.
# Details:
The session storage functionality for document types has already been implemented in the existing components:

1. The ProcessingDocumentsPage stores the primary document type and navigates to the appropriate route
2. The BaseResultsPage loads necessary data from session storage and filters it based on the document type

Tasks to complete:
1. Review the existing implementation in ProcessingDocumentsPage and BaseResultsPage
2. Document how document type storage is currently handled
3. Verify that all document types (balance-sheet, cash-flow, income-statement, assets) are properly supported
4. Ensure the implementation includes proper error handling and data validation
5. Create documentation for the current session storage approach for future reference

No additional session storage utilities need to be created as the functionality is already implemented and working correctly.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the existing session storage implementation in ProcessingDocumentsPage and BaseResultsPage
2. Test navigation between document types to ensure proper data persistence
3. Confirm that document-specific data is correctly filtered based on document type
4. Test error handling for missing or invalid session data
5. Verify backward compatibility with any existing session storage usage
6. Document the test results as part of the implementation documentation
