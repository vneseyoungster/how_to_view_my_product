# Task ID: 17
# Title: Add Multiple Type Document Selection Option
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 11, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a new document type option to CategoryFileUpload.tsx that allows users to upload documents of multiple financial types for comprehensive analysis.
# Details:
This task involves extending the document type options in the file upload component to support multiple document types in a single analysis:

1. Locate and update the DOCUMENT_TYPES array in CategoryFileUpload.tsx to add the new option:
```tsx
export const DOCUMENT_TYPES = [
  // Existing document types
  { id: 'balance-sheet', name: 'Balance Sheet', description: 'Upload balance sheet documents for analysis' },
  { id: 'cash-flow', name: 'Cash Flow', description: 'Upload cash flow documents for analysis' },
  { id: 'income-statement', name: 'Income Statement', description: 'Upload income statement documents for analysis' },
  // New document type
  { id: 'multiple-type', name: 'Multiple Type', description: 'Upload documents of multiple financial types for comprehensive analysis' }
];
```

2. Update any TypeScript interfaces or type definitions that reference document types:
```tsx
// Example type definition update
export type DocumentType = 'balance-sheet' | 'cash-flow' | 'income-statement' | 'multiple-type';
```

3. Ensure the upload flow properly handles the new document type:
   - Update any validation logic to accept multiple document types
   - Modify the document processing logic to handle mixed document scenarios
   - Update any UI components that display document type information

4. Test the integration with the existing ProcessingDocumentsPage to ensure it correctly identifies and routes multiple-type documents.

5. Verify that the DocumentTypeNavigation component is displayed when the multiple-type option is selected, as this will allow users to navigate between different document views.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Verify that the DOCUMENT_TYPES array correctly includes the new multiple-type option
   - Test that TypeScript type definitions are updated and don't produce any type errors
   - Ensure the CategoryFileUpload component correctly displays the new option

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the complete upload flow with the multiple-type option selected
   - Verify that documents are correctly processed and stored
   - Confirm that the ProcessingDocumentsPage correctly identifies multiple-type documents
   - Test navigation to the appropriate results page after upload

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify that the new option is clearly visible and understandable to users
   - Test that the description text accurately conveys the purpose of the multiple-type option
   - Ensure the option is properly styled and consistent with other document type options

4. End-to-End Testing:
   - Complete a full workflow from selection to upload to results viewing
   - Verify that DocumentTypeNavigation appears when using the multiple-type option
   - Test switching between different document views after uploading multiple types
