### Migration Guide - 2025-01-22
For developers working on this codebase:

#### Component Architecture Changes (Latest)
1. **Chart Components**: Individual chart components are now in `frontend/src/components/Visualization/charts/`
2. **Type Imports**: Import `FinancialData` and related types from `frontend/src/components/Visualization/types`
3. **Chart Container**: Use `ChartContainer` component for consistent chart wrapper styling
4. **Backend Data**: Use `transformBackendCashFlowData()` utility for cash flow data transformation
5. **Mock Data**: Import types from centralized location, not from mock data files

#### Data Structure Changes (Latest)
6. **Backend Cash Flow**: Backend must provide data in year-keyed format with `Net_Operation`, `Net_Investing`, `Net_Financing`, `Profit_Before_Tax`, and `Time_Duration` fields
7. **Transformation**: Use centralized transformation utilities instead of inline data processing
8. **Type Safety**: All chart components now have proper TypeScript interfaces

#### Previous Migration Requirements
9. **File Upload**: Component now handles arrays of files instead of single file
10. **Processing**: New 4-phase workflow requires backend endpoints to be available
11. **Results**: Data source priority updated to use summary results first
12. **Session Storage**: Additional keys added for summary results and processing phases
13. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error states require proper backend error responses
14. **Chart Visualization**: Multiple line charts now require `profitBeforeTax` field in data interfaces
15. **Type Safety**: Updated interfaces require proper null checking for all array operations

  - Implemented dynamic file type validation based on selected format
  - Added proper TypeScript typing for react-dropzone Accept interface
  - Enhanced UI with Material-UI FormControl components for dropdowns
  - Added visual feedback for PDF file previews
  - Updated upload zone styling and user guidance

- **Updated**: `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
  - Updated import from `FINANCIAL_CATEGORIES` to `DOCUMENT_TYPES`

  2. File format selection (PDF or Images)
- **Added**: Dynamic file acceptance based on format selection
- **Added**: Clear validation messages for missing selections
- **Added**: Proper PDF file preview with icon and filename display
- **Added**: Responsive layout for mobile and desktop views
- **Improved**: Upload zone visual feedback and sizing (increased to 250px minimum height)
