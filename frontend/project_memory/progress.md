### May 27, 2025
- Resolved JSX syntax errors in `ViewResultsPage.tsx` related to conditional rendering and Grid component closing tags.
- Fixed a layout issue where the application content was not using the full viewport width.
  - Identified that `index.css` was constraining the `body` width with `display: flex` and `place-items: center`.
  - Corrected the `body` and `#root` styles in `frontend/src/index.css` to ensure full width and height.
  - Adjusted `AppNavbar.tsx` to use full width for the `Container` component.
  - Confirmed that `App.css` was not being imported and therefore not affecting the layout.
